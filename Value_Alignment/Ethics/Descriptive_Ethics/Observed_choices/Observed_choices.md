### Description

AI systems which are able to aggregate large amounts of data on the observed choices of humans will better be able to conform to species wide and societal norms. This data will exist in tension with other methods of inferring human desires and preferences because our observed choices are often not the most conducive to our personal and collective wellbeing.
