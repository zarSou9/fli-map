### Description

Descriptive ethics is required to deploy AI that is sensitive to diversity of culture. Robust models which capture the values, preferences, and ethical behaviors of humans across different societies and social groups are necessary for designing AI systems that integrate with and which lead to human flourishing in both the short and long term. In the short term, descriptive ethics may largely be done through classical anthropology, big data, preference aggregation methods, surveys, and polling. In the longer term, we may be able to use inverse reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning methods, or new AI technologies for developing rich and complex accounts of persons moral attitudes, preferences, and beliefs.
