### Mini Description

is an indulgent form of hedonism that supports reiterating more basic and primal pleasures as often as possible, like food, sex, and sleep. It focuses on immediate gratification without much care for the future.

### Description

This form of hedonism is largely viewed as short lasting, damaging, and unsustainable, at least in humans and biological life. For these reasons, it is almost never suggested or defended. In the long-term, as we potentially gain more and more access to different areas of mind-space with different computational structures running on different substrates, it may then become a thing of the past that hedonism such as this is inherently damaging and unsustainable. Perhaps one day, machines and persons can function on informationally sensitive gradients of bliss and this form of hedonism could be realized, though this is highly speculative (Pearce 2015).
