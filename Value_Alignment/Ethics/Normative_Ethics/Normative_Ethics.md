### Mini Description

Examines and contructs the principles and ethical systems we use for assessing the moral worth and permissibility of specific actions and situations.

### Description

Normative ethics can be understood at a variety of levels: It can be instantiated in and internally developed by machines and humans, it is a structure through which we can ascertain and adjudicate the moral worth of actions committed by and moral status of AIs and AI architects, it can provide guiding principles and structures for deciding how to proceed into the future, and is also a system to be constructed, developed, and analyzed downstream of ones own metaethical views as it results from such views. One can also use it to make manifest what is good, true, and/or useful about morality. If we wish to one day realize authentically autonomous AI systems, they will need to learn, have instantiated in them, or some combination of the two, some form of normative ethics in order to guide behavior and generate ethical decisions in novel situations (Wallach 2009). We can consider that this would make them ethical decision makers, as opposed to ethical reasoners (McDermott 2008).

It may also be the case that AIs will need to modify their normative ethical structures and concepts to operate effectively in and be sensitive to the normative human ethical contexts they find themselves in. For example, if AIs develop novel normative ethical structures that dont use human concepts such as rights, duties, property, obligation, etc. then this may be ineffectual and even disturbing in human contexts even if such normative AI ethics properly reflects its own our our own metaethics. Given this, AI normative ethics may also need to evolve mindful of descriptive accounts of human normative ethics and frameworks.
