### Mini Description

Focuses on aligning ones own actions and character with that of a virtuous person. 

### Description

Given that purely consequentialist and deontological normative ethical structures could potentially be computationally intractable without heavy optimization, it may be useful for AIs to generate novel concepts of virtue and also learn those already employed by humans. Actions, intentions, and beliefs of the AI and of persons in general could be correlated with good or desirable outcomes in order to formalize new agential characteristics of virtue and understand old ones.  The development of AI virtues can thus function as a bottom-up approach to machine ethics where the AI system asks, What does it mean for me to be a virtuous AI system? What would a virtuous AI system do? What do humans expect to be the qualities of a virtuous AI system? New and old virtuous characteristics could be used in junction with other normative ethical modules, such as consequentialist, deontological, and unknown possible modules, to maximize the likelihood of a desirable outcome.
