### Description

The impacts of religion and dynamics between it and advanced AI research are unknown and potentially volatile. Most of the world consists of persons that are overtly or tacitly divine command theorists. This will very likely play a huge role in how both short-term and long-term value alignment is done. There may even be strong opposition to certain kinds of AI research from divine command theorists.  More research is needed on the interplay of religion and AI value alignment.
