### Mini Description

Rawls pursues a theory of justice known as Justice as Fairness where he establishes two principles of justice. The first holds that every person should have equal right to the most basic and extensive liberty that is compatible with the similar liberty of others. The second holds that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. (Rawls 1971)

### Description

With the power that AI brings comes the ability to both exacerbate current injustices and generate new injustices through bias and systemic power structures, and yet also comes the ability to create new levels of wealth, equality, reparations, and justice. This is the dual-use nature of technology. AI and justice studies is a new and emerging discipline which deserves more time, consideration, and research.
