### Mini Description

Holds that in order to act morally one must be acting from duty and with the correct motivations, which are determined by Kants categorical imperative. The consequences of an action do not play a central role in this form of ethics.

### Description

While heuristics and general rules may provide some epistemic usefulness, sophisticated Kantian machine ethics may require much computation because Kants ethics requires an understanding of an agents intentions. This requires an understanding of human psychology and a sophisticated causal account of the world and persons. Of course, humans can do this rather efficiently with our brains at a very low scale and sometimes rather inaccurately. Improvements in AI regarding abstract concepts, reasoning, human psychology, one shot learning, and general algorithmic qualities can certainly cut down on computational issues surrounding such theories (Wallach 2009).
