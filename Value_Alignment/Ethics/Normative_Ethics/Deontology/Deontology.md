### Mini Description

Judges the morality of an action or situation based on rights, duties, laws, and obligations persons possess and hold to one another and society at large.

### Description

Deontology may prove to play a foundational role in getting  machine ethics off the ground and with helping to mitigate epistemic difficulties intrinsic to other normative ethical theories through providing decision support and direction. This is due to the fact that deontology uses high level concepts which require broad and general understandings of persons, situations, and consequences. However, forms of deontology which take into account the importance of intention or other difficult to infer mental states may prove more challenging.

AI may learn some form of deontology from humans in order to form a deontological ethical baseline or have some similar foundation hard programmed in. From this base, it can potentially generate novel deontological concepts, such as new virtues, rights, duties, and obligations for both persons and machines. Such concepts may prove to be epistemically useful and/or virtuous in maximizing or respecting deeper ethical intuitions we have, like the need to promote wellbeing and mitigate suffering. At bare minimum, it will be important for general purpose AI systems to understand deontological ethics so that they can be sensitive to human moral psychology and lived experience.
