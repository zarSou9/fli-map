### Mini Description

Holds that the appropriate action or act is that which produces the greatest possible good. 

### Description

In its purest form, where we choose the best action out of all possible actions, act utilitarianism is potentially the most computationally intractable form of utilitarianism.Corners would have to be cut, clever statistical tricks generated, and heuristics developed for this form of utilitarianism to be possible. Given this, it may be the case that in order to be the best act utilitarian one must also employ other forms of normative ethics to assist in the epistemic difficulties of act utilitarianism.
