### Mini Description

Being a cognitivist theory, error theory holds that ethical statements express propositions. However, its central claim is that all such propositions are false. This is to say that moral claims such as murder is bad or murder is good are false. The only moral statements which are not false are negative ones, such as murder is not bad and murder is not good.

### Description

More research is needed on the effects of error theory on value alignment as well as the computational and epistemic implications in machines. If error theory is true then there is no right way to do value alignment. The real question is, if error theory is true then how would this fact affect how we do value alignment?
