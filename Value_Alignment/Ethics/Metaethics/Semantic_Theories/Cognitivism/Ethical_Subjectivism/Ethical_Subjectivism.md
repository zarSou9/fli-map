### Mini Description

Is a form of moral anti-realism that holds that moral statements are propositions made conventionally true or false by the approval, disapproval, and/or conventions of individual persons or groups of people.

### Description

The short-term implications of ethical subjectivism, should it be true, are unclear. From this context, the answer to the question of what we ought to do should this view be true will indeed be subjective and contingent upon the context in which it is asked, but it is unclear if we will continue down our current path of value alignment or radically change course because of this.
