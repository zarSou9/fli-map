### Mini Description

Refers to a group of theories which hold that moral statements are neither true nor false because they do not express genuine propositions.

### Description

If there is no third person or objective way of evaluating the truth value of moral statements then there is no concrete ethical learning protocol for humans or AIs. In terms of value alignment, some evaluative system found in humans or that is constructed by us must make it into advanced AI systems if they are to be moral agents. Given in this context that there are no right or wrong answers to the question of what makes beneficial AI what we choose to do is something to be freely willed and decided upon without boundary.
