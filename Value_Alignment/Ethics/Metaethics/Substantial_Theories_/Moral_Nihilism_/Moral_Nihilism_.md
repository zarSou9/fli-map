### Mini Description

Holds that nothing has intrinsic moral value, nothing is intrinsically good or bad, and that morality is a conventional fiction that lacks objective or relative truth. 

### Description

Given moral nihilism, there arent any strict rules or imperatives for how value alignment ought to be done. In this context, value alignment would potentially play out as a mere power struggle and historical contingency. However, it is also likely  that we would maintain the same ethics we had prior to a moral nihilist awakening. As stated, more research is needed regarding the scale and impact of moral nihilism on value alignment should it be proven true.
