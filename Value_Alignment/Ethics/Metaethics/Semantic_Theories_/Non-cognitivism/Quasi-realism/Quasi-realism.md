### Mini Description

Holds that moral statements conventionally behave like propositions and can be called true or false within the context of human convention, but it is understood that they ultimately do not express genuine propositions. 

### Description

Quasi-realism may function similarly to moral realist positions in the actual world. They hold different ethical epistemologies because of metaphysical differences regarding the existence of moral facts, but quasi-realism may have a  conventional moral-epistemology very similar to moral realist positions because widespread adoption would occur in the same context. Given this, they could end up looking very similar in the end. The relevant question is whether or not human morality would become much more fluid and dynamic given widespread understanding and commitment to quasi-realism. This would affect the scope and impact of this theory should it turn out to be true and thus how much research efforts it deserves. It seems that persons that adopt or accept quasi-realism today do not experience much of a shift in ethics and so this appears to be a position that, should it be true, wouldnt affect the direction of value alignment very much.
