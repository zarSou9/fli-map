### Mini Description

Holds that there are many different values which may be equally correct and fundamental, yet that exist in direct conflict with one another. For example, this view would claim that  the moral life of a nun is incompatible with that of a mother, yet there is no purely rational measure of which is preferable or morally superior.

### Description

This view and the view of value monism boil down to the question of whether or not there are multiple intrinsic values. Value pluralism would answer that there are more than one intrinsic values. Given this, it would be the job of AI and/or humans to identify the space of all intrinsic values and navigate in a way that is appropriate and reflects the relevant metaethical and normative considerations.
