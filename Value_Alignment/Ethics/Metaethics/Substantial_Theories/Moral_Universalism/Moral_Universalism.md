### Mini Description

Is the metaethical position that states that ethical systems are universally applicable. This is to say, regardless of a persons culture, race, sex, religion, nationality, sexuality or other distinguishing feature, that said person is an equal patient and agent within the context of some system of ethics.

### Description

Given this position, it would be prudent for humans to work to isolate and understand which ethical principles, codes, or values are universally applicable. The implications of this would somewhat negate the need for culturally sensitive AI systems.
