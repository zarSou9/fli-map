### Mini Description

Holds that all moral judgements are arbitrary and contingent aspects of different persons' culture or personal views. It argues that there is no objective moral standard by which one can assess the truth of a moral proposition. There exists only a plurality of different moral views which all lack the same fundamental grounding ability to be assessed and are not universalizable.

### Description

For the world in which moral relativism holds to be true and is widely spread and adopted, what is important to wonder is how the adoption of this metaethical position changes and affects current moral attitudes as well as affects value alignment. The answer to this question is salient because it affects metaethical research prioritization in the present day. If a metaethical theory doesnt change the way in which value alignment is done, relative to the current general path, then its not of much consequential import. More research is needed in moral psychology and metaethics regarding the implications of such theories in value alignment.
