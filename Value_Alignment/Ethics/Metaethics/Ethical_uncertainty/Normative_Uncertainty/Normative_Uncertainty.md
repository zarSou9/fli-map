### Mini Description

Seeks to understand the appropriate use cases of and provide a commitment to different ethical theories that guide our behavior in daily life given our moral uncertainty.

### Description

There is much disagreement about which metaethical views are correct. Given this uncertainty, there is consequently much uncertainty about the appropriate application of normative ethical theories. As long as there is metaethical uncertainty, there will be uncertainty in normative ethics as it is downstream of and its success is contingent upon true metaethics.

Ideally one would want to determine if there are any methods approaching objectivity for enumerating, generating, or ranking value systems. This kind of metaethics explores more first-principles approaches to ethics. Questions about the most proper thing for one to do when they're uncertain about what ought to be done in the first place arise (MacAskill 2014, Tegmark 2015). Figuring out what norms govern uncertainty about normative claims, and how can uncertainty about moral claims can be resolved are both open areas of investigation (MacAskill 2014). Answers to these questions are reasonable baseline proxies to help reason about what sorts of conclusions the operators would come to if they had much more knowledge and much more time to think and develop (Soares and Fallenstein 2014a, Bostrom 2014). These problems are largely still in the realm of philosophy rather than computer science, but interdisciplinary approaches would seem to be be called for in order to explore different angles on this problem.
