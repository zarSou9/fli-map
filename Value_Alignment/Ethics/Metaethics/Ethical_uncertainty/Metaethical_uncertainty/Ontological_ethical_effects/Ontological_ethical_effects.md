### Mini Description

Seeks to update all of our ethical theories as we learn more about what exists in the world and its relation(s) to other existing things.

### Description

In humans, differences in world models, mereologies, and other ontological dualistic concepts, understandings, and thought structures have great implications in our ethics and lived experience of the world. This can specifically be seen in the ethical consequences of the illusions of self and free will in humans and their impacts on justice, view of self and other, selfishness, and in responsibility and duty. In the long term, new understandings about the multiverse or parallel universes may require that we update our ethics to account for this new information.
