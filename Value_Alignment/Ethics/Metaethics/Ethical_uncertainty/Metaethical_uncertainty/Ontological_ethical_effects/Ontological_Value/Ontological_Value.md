### Description

Within philosophical ontology, there are questions remaining regarding the theoretical underpinnings of the nature of, and treatment of, worth and value. The structural relationships between worth, value, value evaluation, morals, ethical systems, and instantiated ethical systems are insufficiently resolved for the present purposes with long-term AI. Another significant open question is whether there can exist objective values, and if so, how can they be derived.
