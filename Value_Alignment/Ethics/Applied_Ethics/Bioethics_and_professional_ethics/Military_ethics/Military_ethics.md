Studies morality in war and conflict. 

### Description

Currently, there are ethical concerns about the creation and use of lethal autonomous weapons. These are weapons systems which are able to kill targets without meaningful human control. As AI becomes more powerful and we begin to better understand intelligence, AI can be used to wage war in all of the traditional ways, and even in novel ways, to a degree that surpasses human creativity, capacity, and cruelty. Given that intelligence can be used for arbitrary ends, this branch of ethics is important as it again emphasizes the need for beneficial intelligence, and not undirected intelligence.
