### Mini Description

Studies how the moral status of feelings, emotions, and experiences foreign to human consciousness might be evaluated. 

### Description

Lacking a science of consciousness, there is broad disagreement about what is required to generate consciousness in machines and how consciousness relates to or is contingent upon computation. Given this, we should be mindful going forth as we create more and more powerful AI systems as we may generate known and unknown forms of suffering at digital timescales. Thus, it may be wise not to risk experiential/phenomenal states in machines without first having a better understanding of the neural/computational correlates of consciousness. Human history can be viewed as having long eras where institutions and practices that generate vast amounts of suffering are viewed as normal and morally acceptable. Things of this nature range from slavery, oppression of women, genocide, racism, factory farming, and more. It would be wise and prudent to carry on into the future with the history of our continual moral failings in mind so that we do not generate a novel and unseen ethical catastrophe through AI.

As we approach the longer term and create machines of human level intelligence or beyond, we may begin generating completely novel experiential states in machines which have no analogue in human consciousness due to the alien computational structures and algorithms in said AIs. Consequently, a deeply difficult issue arises regarding ascertaining and adjudicating the moral value and ethical status of feelings, hedonic states, and experiences that are foreign to human consciousness.
