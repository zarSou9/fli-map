### Mini Description

Seeks to prepare for technological and scientific discovery that will likely bring us to a whole host of new and perhaps exotic ethical situations and dilemmas.

### Description

Could our earliest ancestors have ever of dreamt of multiverse theory or that the metals and minerals of the mountains and earth would be built into thinking machines powered by the same forces that created lightning in the sky? If not, they could not have anticipated ethical issues resulting from discoveries or inventions such as these either. We might then ask: Are there such advances and novel situations that we are unable to predict? What might they be? How much should this impact our current decision making and actions with regards to AI?
