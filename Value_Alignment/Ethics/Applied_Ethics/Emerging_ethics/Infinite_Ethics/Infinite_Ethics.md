### Description

In the very long term, something like superintelligence may have to make novel ethical decisions given information regarding the newest breakthroughs in cosmology. We may wish to ask ourselves, how are we to and what does it mean to create value aligned AI with such possible future scenarios in mind?

For any rational agent able to re-derive or weigh ethics, the question of infinite ethics arises, i.e. how to treat the potentially overwhelming significance of existing or potential sentient entities in what is potentially an infinite universe. There are solutions that utilize an agent's uncertainty and solutions that cite causal lightcones, both enabling the accessible to garner most moral attention, but there are still some open questions (Bostrom and others 2011).
