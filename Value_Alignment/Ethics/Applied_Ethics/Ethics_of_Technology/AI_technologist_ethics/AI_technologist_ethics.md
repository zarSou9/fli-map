Studies ethics with regards to the creation and implementation of AI in the world.

### Description

As the architects of extremely powerful systems, which will be agents and potentially even patients of morality, AI researchers and developers bear a special ethical responsibility. This responsibility calls on AI researchers to be ethically informed, embodied, and engage in their work with the end goal of beneficence. The amount of care and effort put into the ethical design of beneficial AI systems should be commensurate with the expected impact (Lin 2017).
