### Mini Description

Is an intellectual movement which seeks to use science and technology to fundamentally improve the human condition through augmenting or changing human biology.

### Description

As AI becomes more powerful across more domains, our ability to augment and change the human, into what might one day be a posthuman state, greatly improves. AI will likely be a catalyst for opening a whole new set of ethical issues surrounding human augmentation, designer babies, identity, and more. AI may give previously inactionable ideological systems the ability to finally strive towards their ends (Bostrom 2005).
