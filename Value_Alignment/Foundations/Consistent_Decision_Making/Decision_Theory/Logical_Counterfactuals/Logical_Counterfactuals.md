### Mini Description

Methods for evaluating hypothetical scenarios where logical realities and consequences are different than they are

### Description

Consideration of hypothetical scenarios in which logical realities and consequences were different than they currently are can and should be evaluated to support causal understanding, understanding of current options, and to enable the generalization of regret terms in learning algorithms. In a counterfactual situation where a given deterministic decision procedure selects a different action from the one it selects in reality, how can one determine the implications of this counterfactual on other algorithms? ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)) I.e., is there some satisfactory way to formalize and generalize logical counterfactuals? ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)) A method for reasoning about logical counterfactuals in the first place seems a prerequisite to formalizing a more general theory of counterfactuals ([Soares and Fallenstein 2015](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40b3/bbe8d3e0ff66caae3217f4b2fc0e71fd01e2.pdf)). While updateless decision theory consistently theoretically outperforms causal decision theory, it will remain an abstraction until such formalizations of counterfactuals are developed ([Hintze 2014](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf), [LaVictoire et al. 2014](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW14/paper/viewFile/8833/8294)). Relatedly an analysis of Lob's theorem in bounded scenarios has implications for cooperative behavior ([Critch 2016](http://acritch.com/media/ai/Andrew_Critch_-_Parametric_Bounded_Lob.pdf)).
