Dealing with the fact that no sufficiently strong formal system can know that everything that it proves to be true is actually true

### Description

The LÃ¶bian obstacle, essentially that no sufficiently strong formal system can know that everything that it proves to be true is actually true, is a formidable issue when considering recursive verification ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). An important question to resolve is how can agents gain very high confidence in agents that use similar reasoning systems while avoiding paradoxes of self-reference ([Fallenstein and Soares 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf)).
