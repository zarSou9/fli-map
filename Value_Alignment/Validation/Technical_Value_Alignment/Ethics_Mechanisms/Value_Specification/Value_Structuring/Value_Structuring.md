Architectural approaches to encouraging beneficence

### Description

How can one structurally, algorithmically ensure that the core values of advanced learning agents meet broad beneficence constraints? Arguments have been made that they should be heavily informed by analyzing how humans structure their value systems ([Greene 2014](https://joshgreene.squarespace.com/s/beyond-point-and-shoot-morality-a4h2.pdf), [Sarma and Hay 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08289), [Jara-Ettinger et al. 2013](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0141/index.html)).
