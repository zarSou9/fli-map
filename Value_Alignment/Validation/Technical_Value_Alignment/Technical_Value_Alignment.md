### Mini Description

Ensuring that an agent conforms to the implicit or explicit ethical values of humanity or its creators or operators

### Description

Researchers expect that highly intelligent agents would be able to pursue arbitrary end-goals that are independent of moral values, since intelligence and values are hypothesized to be orthogonal ([Bostrom 2012](http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf)). Values are ethical norms, constraints, and moral weights one places on properties and relationships in the world. Ensuring that a system conceptualizes and uses its intelligence in a<b> beneficial</b> manner requires more than accuracy ([Soares 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf)). It has been argued that a single fixed pithy solution to machine ethics may be rather hole-ridden, brittle, and deficient in fairness ([Brundage 2014](http://www.milesbrundage.com/uploads/2/1/6/8/21681226/limitations_and_risks_of_machine_ethics.pdf)). Even Asimov's deontological scenarios illustrate such loopholes, thus the need much more comprehensive paradigms ([Weld and Etzioni 1994](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~weld/papers/first-law-aaai94.pdf)). As systems become more capable, more epistemically-difficult methods of value loading could become viable, suggesting that research on such methods could be useful ([Bostrom 2014](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112)). A portfolio approach is warranted to support a variety of methods for specifying goals indirectly and semi-indirectly.
