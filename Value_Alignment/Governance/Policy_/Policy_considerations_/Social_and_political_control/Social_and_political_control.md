### Mini Description

 Groups or individuals can exert control over social and political events through many kinds of tactics. Political propaganda, which aims to persuade people of a particular message that may or may not be accurate, has a long history and is alive and well today. By combining old psychological tactics with new social media and AI technologies, the capacity for much more widespread and targeted propaganda efforts is now being realized.

### Description

Our actions online generate enormous amounts of data not only about what we buy, but also about what we think and want. Companies like Cambridge Analytica have shown that personalizing messages based upon this big data can have a lot of power in swaying political outcomes (Grassegger and Krogerus, 2017). Fake news is another important phenomenon in the ongoing story of efforts to manipulate social and political understandings. Both fake news and targeted messaging played a role in the 2016 US presidential election (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017).
