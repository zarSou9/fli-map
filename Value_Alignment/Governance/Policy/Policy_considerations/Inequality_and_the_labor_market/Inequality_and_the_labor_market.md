### Mini Description

Inequality refers to a difference or imbalance in circumstances. Technological change can lead to rapid changes in the labor market and either reduce or increase conditions of inequality.

### Description

Automating processes via computation and robotics is likely to impact everyone, but will not hit all regions or sectors of the labor market equally (Frey and Osborne, 2013). Universal basic income is a proposed solution to this inequality (Brynjolfsson 2014).
