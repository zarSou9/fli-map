### Mini Description

Bias is prejudice in favor or against a person, group, or thing. Algorithmic bias occurs when the data being used to teach a machine learning system includes instances of bias, or when peoples own implicit values influence the collection, selection, or use of data.

### Description

Algorithms trained on existing data can unintentionally magnify and institutionalize biases present in the world. For example, algorithms have been found showing ads for high-income jobs to men much more often than to women, and showing ads for arrest records more frequently under searches of distinctively black names (Hajian, Bonchi, and Castillo, 2016).
