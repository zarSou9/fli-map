### Mini Description

The definition of autonomous weapons is contentious because of the continuum of autonomy present in weapon systems, but generally they are defined as robots designed to select and attack targets without human intervention.

### Description

Many semi-autonomous weapon systems already exist around the world (Boulanin and Verbruggen, 2017), but there is an increasingly vocal movement from civil society organizations and scientists that fully autonomous lethal weapons should be banned (Docherty, 2016).
