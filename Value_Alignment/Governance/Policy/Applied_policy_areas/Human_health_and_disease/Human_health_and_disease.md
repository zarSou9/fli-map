### Mini Description

Health is a state of physical, mental, and social wellbeing, while disease is one factor that negatively impacts that state.

### Description

AI is being used to sort through and make sense of massive amounts of biomedical data to help with drug development, diagnosis, and treatment, which could improve care, lead to the generation of new treatments, reduce costs, and bring health insights to those who have limited access to doctors and care. The use of AI could also accelerate development of more experimental human biotechnologies such as CRISPR gene editing or neuro-enhancement. We could see a cultural shift as healthcare moves from being more reactive to more proactive and predictive (i.e. resulting in previvors). However, increasing quantification of human bodies poses social and ethical dilemmas about control and cultural/political understandings of bodies.
