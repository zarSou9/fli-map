### Mini Description

Policing is one aspect of the criminal justice system intended to uphold social control, deter crime, and sanction those who violate laws. The role of AI and algorithmic tools in policing is controversial.

### Description

The use of algorithms in policing became highly controversial after an independent report found that the COMPAS tool, being used to predict inmates likelihood of recidivism, was systematically giving higher likelihoods to people of color (Angwin et al., 2016). A legal case of Eric Loomis against COMPAS went up to the Wisconsin Supreme Court (but was turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court). Loomis argued he was denied due process since the algorithm is proprietary.
