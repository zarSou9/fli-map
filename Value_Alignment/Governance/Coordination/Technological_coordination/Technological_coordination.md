### Mini Description

 Technology itself shapes our reality and defines what is possible within the spaces  both virtual and real  that we inhabit.

Computer code and algorithms increasingly structure our social, financial, and political worlds (Lessig, 2000). However, technology companies are largely driven by profit and growth motives rather than resilience or human flourishing, and the idea that technology will naturally act in our interests is unwarranted (Ito, 2017).
