### Mini Description

Coordination is the process of reaching a working consensus within a defined (though not static) group or category. It refers to the structures through which governance occurs.

### Description

What mechanisms exist to help align human and machine values? How is it that particular value systems emerge as dominant in regards to novel technologies? Who is part of these conversations and how are decisions made? Coordination in value alignment is about consensus-making through existing systems of influence. Strategies for the development of AI at the technological, international, national, and organizational levels help structure imaginaries of appropriate value systems.
